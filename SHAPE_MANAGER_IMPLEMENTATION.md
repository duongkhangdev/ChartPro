# ShapeManager Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the ShapeManager with undo/redo functionality for ChartPro.

## Overview

The ShapeManager feature adds comprehensive shape management capabilities to ChartPro, including:
- Centralized tracking of all drawn shapes
- Undo/redo operations using the Command pattern
- Shape selection and deletion
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations

## Architecture

### Command Pattern

The implementation uses the Command pattern to enable undo/redo:

```
ICommand (interface)
├── AddShapeCommand
└── DeleteShapeCommand
```

Each command implements:
- `Execute()` - Performs the operation
- `Undo()` - Reverses the operation
- `Description` - Human-readable description

### Shape Management

```
IShapeManager (interface)
└── ShapeManager (implementation)
    ├── _shapes: List<DrawnShape>
    ├── _undoStack: Stack<ICommand>
    └── _redoStack: Stack<ICommand>
```

### Shape Metadata

Each shape is wrapped in a `DrawnShape` object containing:
- `Id`: Unique identifier (Guid)
- `Plottable`: The ScottPlot IPlottable object
- `DrawMode`: The drawing mode used to create it
- `IsSelected`: Selection state
- `IsVisible`: Visibility state
- `CreatedAt`: Creation timestamp

## Key Features

### 1. Undo/Redo Stack

- Unlimited history (limited only by memory)
- Clear redo stack when new command is executed
- Commands can be undone and redone multiple times
- Stack operations are thread-safe for the single-threaded UI context

### 2. Keyboard Shortcuts

Implemented in `MainForm.cs`:
- **Ctrl+Z**: Undo last operation
- **Ctrl+Y** or **Ctrl+Shift+Z**: Redo last undone operation
- **Delete**: Delete selected shapes
- **Escape**: Cancel current drawing mode

### 3. Shape Selection

- Click on a shape (in None mode) to select it
- Ctrl+Click to toggle selection (multi-select)
- Click on empty area (without Ctrl) to deselect all
- Selected shapes displayed with thicker lines (3px vs 2px)

### 4. Integration with ChartInteractions

All shape operations go through the command pattern:

```csharp
// Adding a shape
var shape = new DrawnShape(plottable, drawMode);
var command = new AddShapeCommand(_shapeManager, shape, _formsPlot.Plot);
_shapeManager.ExecuteCommand(command);

// Deleting selected shapes
var command = new DeleteShapeCommand(_shapeManager, shape, _formsPlot.Plot);
_shapeManager.ExecuteCommand(command);
```

## Testing

### Test Coverage

The `ChartPro.Tests` project includes comprehensive tests:

**ShapeManagerTests.cs** (7 tests):
- Initialization
- Add/remove operations
- Shape lookup by ID
- Clear operation

**CommandTests.cs** (8 tests):
- Command execution and undo
- Undo/redo stack management
- Multiple operations
- Stack clearing behavior

**DrawnShapeTests.cs** (5 tests):
- Construction and initialization
- Property management
- Unique ID generation
- Null parameter validation

### Running Tests

```bash
# Compile tests (works on all platforms)
dotnet build ChartPro.Tests/ChartPro.Tests.csproj

# Run tests (requires Windows)
dotnet test ChartPro.Tests/ChartPro.Tests.csproj
```

## API Reference

### IShapeManager Interface

```csharp
public interface IShapeManager
{
    IReadOnlyList<DrawnShape> Shapes { get; }
    void ExecuteCommand(ICommand command);
    bool Undo();
    bool Redo();
    bool CanUndo { get; }
    bool CanRedo { get; }
    void Clear();
    DrawnShape? GetShapeById(Guid id);
    void RemoveShape(DrawnShape shape);
    void AddShape(DrawnShape shape);
}
```

### IChartInteractions Extensions

New methods added:

```csharp
public interface IChartInteractions : IDisposable
{
    // ... existing methods ...
    
    IShapeManager ShapeManager { get; }
    bool Undo();
    bool Redo();
    void DeleteSelectedShapes();
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory**: Each shape stores minimal metadata (~100 bytes)
- **Undo Stack**: Unbounded, but practical limit is memory
- **Selection**: O(n) search for clicked shape (could be optimized with spatial indexing)
- **Visual Updates**: Only refresh when necessary (after undo/redo/delete)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Shape Move/Resize**: Implement MoveShapeCommand and ResizeShapeCommand
2. **Spatial Indexing**: Use R-tree or quadtree for faster shape selection
3. **Persistence**: Save/load shapes to JSON or binary format
4. **Properties Panel**: Edit shape properties (color, line width, style)
5. **Layer Management**: Group shapes into layers with visibility control
6. **Better Selection Visual**: Add highlighted outlines or selection handles
7. **Compound Commands**: Group multiple operations into single undo unit
8. **Command History UI**: Show list of operations with preview on hover

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `ChartPro/Charting/Commands/ICommand.cs`
- `ChartPro/Charting/Commands/AddShapeCommand.cs`
- `ChartPro/Charting/Commands/DeleteShapeCommand.cs`
- `ChartPro/Charting/Shapes/DrawnShape.cs`
- `ChartPro/Charting/Shapes/IShapeManager.cs`
- `ChartPro/Charting/Shapes/ShapeManager.cs`
- `ChartPro.Tests/*` (entire test project)

### Modified Files

- `ChartPro/Charting/Interactions/ChartInteractions.cs`
- `ChartPro/MainForm.cs`
- `ChartPro.sln`
- `README.md`

## Acceptance Criteria Status

All acceptance criteria from the original issue have been met:

✅ ShapeManager tracks all shapes and their metadata  
✅ Command stack for undo/redo available via keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y)  
✅ Integration with selection and edit UX  
✅ Unit tests for ShapeManager and Command logic  

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a solid foundation for shape management in ChartPro. The use of the Command pattern ensures extensibility for future operations (move, resize, rotate, etc.), while the clean separation of concerns maintains code quality and testability.
