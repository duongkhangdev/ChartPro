# Shape Selection Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of shape selection functionality with metadata for IPlottable objects in ChartPro.

## Problem Statement

The original issue identified that shape selection was stubbed and not functional due to the lack of metadata on IPlottable objects. The goal was to implement a mechanism to associate metadata (such as selection state, shape type, and unique identifier) with each IPlottable added to the chart.

## Solution

### 1. DrawnShape Metadata Wrapper

The existing `DrawnShape` class was already present but not integrated with the ShapeManager. It provides:

- `Guid Id`: Unique identifier for each shape
- `IPlottable Plottable`: Reference to the underlying ScottPlot object
- `ChartDrawMode DrawMode`: Type of shape (TrendLine, Rectangle, Circle, etc.)
- `bool IsSelected`: Selection state
- `bool IsVisible`: Visibility state
- `DateTime CreatedAt`: Creation timestamp

### 2. Updated IShapeManager Interface

Extended the interface to support selection operations:

```csharp
public interface IShapeManager : IDisposable
{
    // Updated to use DrawnShape instead of IPlottable
    void AddShape(DrawnShape shape);
    void DeleteShape(DrawnShape shape);
    IReadOnlyList<DrawnShape> Shapes { get; }
    
    // New selection methods
    DrawnShape? SelectShapeAt(int pixelX, int pixelY, bool addToSelection = false);
    void ToggleSelection(DrawnShape shape);
    void ClearSelection();
    IReadOnlyList<DrawnShape> SelectedShapes { get; }
    void DeleteSelectedShapes();
    
    // Existing undo/redo methods remain unchanged
    bool Undo();
    bool Redo();
    bool CanUndo { get; }
    bool CanRedo { get; }
}
```

### 3. ShapeManager Implementation

**Key Changes:**

1. **DrawnShape Tracking**: Now tracks `List<DrawnShape>` instead of `List<IPlottable>`
2. **Plottable Mapping**: Maintains `Dictionary<IPlottable, DrawnShape>` for efficient lookup during undo/redo
3. **Selection Methods**: Implemented all selection-related methods
4. **Visual Updates**: Updates shape appearance based on selection state using reflection

**Selection Algorithm:**

```csharp
public DrawnShape? SelectShapeAt(int pixelX, int pixelY, bool addToSelection)
{
    // Convert pixel to data coordinates
    var coords = _formsPlot.Plot.GetCoordinates(pixelX, pixelY);
    
    // Find closest shape within threshold (5% of visible range)
    // Uses distance to shape's bounding box center
    // Returns null if no shape found within threshold
    
    // Updates selection state and visual appearance
}
```

**Visual Feedback:**

- Selected shapes: Line width increased by 1.5x, color changed to yellow
- Uses reflection to modify `LineWidth` and `LineColor` properties
- Works across different plottable types (lines, rectangles, circles, etc.)

### 4. ChartInteractions Integration

Updated `ChartInteractions` to:

1. **Create DrawnShape instances** when finalizing shapes:
```csharp
var drawnShape = new DrawnShape(plottable, _currentDrawMode);
_shapeManager.AddShape(drawnShape);
```

2. **Handle mouse selection** in `OnMouseDown`:
```csharp
if (_currentDrawMode == ChartDrawMode.None)
{
    HandleShapeSelection(e.X, e.Y, Control.ModifierKeys);
}
```

3. **Implement HandleShapeSelection**:
```csharp
private void HandleShapeSelection(int pixelX, int pixelY, Keys modifiers)
{
    bool addToSelection = (modifiers & Keys.Control) == Keys.Control;
    var selectedShape = _shapeManager.SelectShapeAt(pixelX, pixelY, addToSelection);
    // Updates UI and refreshes plot
}
```

4. **Implement DeleteSelectedShapes**:
```csharp
public void DeleteSelectedShapes()
{
    _shapeManager.DeleteSelectedShapes();
    _formsPlot?.Refresh();
}
```

### 5. Command Pattern Compatibility

The implementation maintains compatibility with the existing Command pattern:

- Commands still work with `IPlottable` objects
- `ShapeManager` maintains the mapping between `IPlottable` and `DrawnShape`
- Undo/Redo operations properly update both the shape list and the mapping

### 6. Updated Tests

All existing tests were updated to use `DrawnShape`:

```csharp
// Before
var line = formsPlot.Plot.Add.Line(0, 0, 10, 10);
shapeManager.AddShape(line);

// After
var line = formsPlot.Plot.Add.Line(0, 0, 10, 10);
var drawnShape = new DrawnShape(line, ChartDrawMode.TrendLine);
shapeManager.AddShape(drawnShape);
```

New tests added for:
- `SelectShapeAt()` functionality
- `ToggleSelection()` behavior
- `ClearSelection()` operation
- `SelectedShapes` property
- `DeleteSelectedShapes()` with undo/redo

## User Experience

### Interaction Flow

1. **Single Selection**: Click on a shape (when no drawing mode is active)
2. **Multi-Selection**: Hold `Ctrl` and click on multiple shapes
3. **Clear Selection**: Click on empty space without `Ctrl`
4. **Visual Feedback**: Selected shapes are highlighted with increased line width and yellow color
5. **Delete**: Call `DeleteSelectedShapes()` to remove selected shapes (supports undo)

### Keyboard Support (for future UI implementation)

- `Delete`: Delete selected shapes
- `Ctrl+A`: Select all shapes (can be implemented)
- `Escape`: Clear selection (can be implemented)
- `Ctrl+Z`: Undo (already supported)
- `Ctrl+Y`: Redo (already supported)

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Metadata Wrapper Pattern

**Decision**: Use `DrawnShape` as a wrapper around `IPlottable` instead of extending `IPlottable`.

**Rationale**:
- Non-invasive: Doesn't modify ScottPlot's interfaces
- Flexible: Can add any metadata without affecting rendering
- Clean separation: Application logic separate from rendering logic
- Extensible: Easy to add more metadata in the future

### 2. Dictionary Mapping

**Decision**: Maintain `Dictionary<IPlottable, DrawnShape>` mapping.

**Rationale**:
- Efficient lookup during undo/redo: O(1) instead of O(n)
- Preserves metadata across command operations
- Enables bidirectional navigation between plottable and metadata

### 3. Reflection-Based Visual Updates

**Decision**: Use reflection to update shape properties based on selection state.

**Rationale**:
- Works across different plottable types
- Doesn't require knowledge of specific plottable implementations
- Simple and maintainable
- Performance impact is negligible for typical use cases

**Trade-off**: Less type-safe than specific implementations per shape type.

### 4. Distance-Based Selection

**Decision**: Use distance to bounding box center for selection.

**Rationale**:
- Simple and fast
- Works reasonably well for most shapes
- Easy to understand and debug

**Future Enhancement**: Implement shape-specific hit testing for more accurate selection.

## Performance Characteristics

- **Memory**: ~100 bytes per shape (DrawnShape metadata + dictionary entry)
- **Selection**: O(n) linear search through all shapes
- **Undo/Redo**: O(1) lookup via dictionary
- **Visual Update**: O(1) reflection-based property update

**Scalability**: Works well for typical use cases (< 1000 shapes). For larger datasets, consider spatial indexing.

## API Surface Changes

### Breaking Changes

1. `IShapeManager.AddShape()` signature changed from `IPlottable` to `DrawnShape`
2. `IShapeManager.DeleteShape()` signature changed from `IPlottable` to `DrawnShape`
3. `IShapeManager.Shapes` property type changed from `IReadOnlyList<IPlottable>` to `IReadOnlyList<DrawnShape>`

### New APIs

1. `IShapeManager.SelectShapeAt(int pixelX, int pixelY, bool addToSelection)`
2. `IShapeManager.ToggleSelection(DrawnShape shape)`
3. `IShapeManager.ClearSelection()`
4. `IShapeManager.SelectedShapes` property
5. `IShapeManager.DeleteSelectedShapes()`

### Migration Path

```csharp
// Old code
var plottable = plot.Add.Line(0, 0, 10, 10);
shapeManager.AddShape(plottable);

// New code
var plottable = plot.Add.Line(0, 0, 10, 10);
var drawnShape = new DrawnShape(plottable, ChartDrawMode.TrendLine);
shapeManager.AddShape(drawnShape);

// Access underlying plottable if needed
var plottable = drawnShape.Plottable;
```
